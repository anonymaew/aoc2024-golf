# Advent of Code 2024 Golfing

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 challenge but in
[codegolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) style.

## Why

Some people use this opportunity to learn new coding language, some pursuing
global leaderboard, but why not codegolfing? It's fun and (too) addictive. I
get to optimize and use skills that are purely useless in real world.

## Stats

In this case, I use Python3.12 with standard library only for golfing, no NumPy
or other external libraries. `wc -c` for counting "golfing" score.

| Challenges | Bytes count |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `golfs/01-1.py` | `119` | <!-- STATS -->
| `golfs/01-2.py` | `113` | <!-- STATS -->
| `total` | `232` | <!-- STATS -->
