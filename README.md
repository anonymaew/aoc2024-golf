# Advent of Code 2024 Golfing

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 challenge but in
[codegolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) style.

## Why

Some people use this opportunity to learn new coding language, some pursuing
global leaderboard, but why not codegolfing? It's fun and (too) addictive. I
get to optimize and use skills that are purely useless in real world.

## Rules

- Python version 3.12 (or higher)
- No external libraries: NumPy, etc. Only standard libraries.
- The program receives input via `stdin` (piped), output on `stdout`

## Stats

Populated using `summarize.sh`, which uses `wc -c` for counting "golfing" score
and modify `README.md` stats.
